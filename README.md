# Edventure---Salesforce-Agentforce NYC2024 Hackathon 

Participating in the Agentforce Hackathon was a defining moment in my journey as a Salesforce professional. Collaborating with a talented team, I developed Agentforce Edventure, a no-code Salesforce solution designed to empower students in their academic journey.

Edventure uses automated agent assistance to help students identify and apply to colleges based on their academic scores, significantly simplifying the application process. The project harnessed Salesforce's cutting-edge tools, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLM), Flows, and Experience Cloud, to create an intuitive and impactful user experience.

The success of this project was recognized when it was featured on the Salesforce Admin YouTube podcast, where I showcased its capabilities and shared insights about the development process.

This experience solidified my passion for combining creativity and technology to solve real-world problems. It reinforced my belief in the transformative power of Salesforce and innovative tools in creating meaningful change.
